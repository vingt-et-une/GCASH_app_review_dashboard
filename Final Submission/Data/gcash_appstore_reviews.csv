Why 4 star not 5 then? 
I think there is a need for the following upgrades: 

1. GCredit
Allow users to pay it in installment. Like for 5,000 they can choose of to pay it within 3 to 5 months. 

Include card for GCredit

2. Customer Service
You know what to do. Customer service is really 1/5, honestly. 

3. User interface and security
Allow users to log in using only fingerprint. 

4. Partner Establishments
Some cashiers don‚Äôt know how to transact using GCash pushing some establishments not to offer it to customers
