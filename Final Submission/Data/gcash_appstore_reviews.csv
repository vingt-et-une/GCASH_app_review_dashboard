How difficult is it to delete a middle name?
They are just trolling me by asking many many many questions and transferring me to the next team!
Yes! To the next team and the cycle starts again! 

They asked many personal and high security questions and requirements such as signature and selfie and every single ID you have.
And then after that, NOTHING!
Although I should mention to all you people that Gcash is Irresponsible for any of your problems. Understand?! If you lost your money inside. That’s gone.... if you can not transfer... it’s gone.... and if you are thinking to withdraw from Gcash card. It has 50PHP interest.

This is a good app for cashless transactions but still has a lot to improve. Here are the problems I am experiencing 
1. When I link my BPI account here, it’s weird that it won’t take the password for my BPI app, I ended changing my password in BPI for 6 times. It always show that the password is wrong so the BPI app blocked my account and password needed to be changed.

2. Transaction History - I think it would be great if the transaction history shows the receipt generated after the transaction and by the way, sending the transaction history to my email is not working

3. In addition to the transactiob history, when I export/save the transaction receipt to my phone, it is cut off in the middle. I don’t know why but yes it is cut off right in the middle.

4. Some fields aren’t working - I am saving BIR as a biller, but when I tap on “preferred biller name” it is not working. Hence I cannot save this biller and I have to go through the usual process when I pay bills.

I don’t know with GCash, but I suggest if they intend to update or correct their server development, it should be on their beta. It is not good that it damages the entire system, other transactions, withdrawal, cash-ins, bills, and many more - where people expect it to be used in needs of emergency.

We cannot load our mobile data and pay bills and stuffs because it’s almost everyday or every week that they do maintenance affecting the whole Gcash App.

When I started using GCASH, everything seems to be getting easier. Paying your food bill with just a scan, purchasing your new OOTD and more... But, what I love the most is that they always give back to their users. I, personally, get a lot of vouchers, discounts from stores, promos from food purchases and even money back with bills payment.

First, I used Gcash because I have a job that pays through Paypal and since it is more convenient to encash using Gcash via Paypal. What if we need the money as soon as possible and because of that system everything was delayed. If this will still happen I'd rather encash paypal to my bank account directly and wait for 3 days to get the money than to use Gcash and be afraid of doing transactions as it may fail again.
